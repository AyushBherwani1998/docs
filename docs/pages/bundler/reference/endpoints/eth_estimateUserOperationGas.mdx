# eth_estimateUserOperationGas

:::tip[Tip]
This method will *not* revert if the `signature` field in the user operation fails. However, most account implementations require the signature to be well formed, which usually means it must have the correct length.

For SimpleAccount, you can use the following dummy signature to put in the `signature` field during gas estimation:

```txt
0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff0000000000000000000000000000000007aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa1c
```
:::

This method simulates the user operation and estimates the appropriate gas limits for it.

If the operation is not successful, it will return an error.
