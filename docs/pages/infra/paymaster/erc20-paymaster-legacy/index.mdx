# ERC-20 Paymaster (legacy)

:::warning
This page shows the documentation for the older version of our ERC-20 paymaster, which is now deprecated. We recommend using the new version of the ERC-20 paymaster, which is manages prices more effectively, allows for the usage of the paymaster without first having approved tokens to it before the validation step, and specific to the v0.7 EntryPoint. You can find the documentation for the new version [here](/infra/paymaster/erc20-paymaster).
