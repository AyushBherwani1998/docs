# How to calculate UserOperation's costs using the ERC-20 Paymaster

This guide will show you how to estimate your user operation's cost in denomination of the ERC-20 token as well as USD.

When using Pimlico's ERC-20 Paymaster, the `pimlico_getTokenQuotes` endpoint helps you calculate the cost of your userOperation. It returns values `exchangeRate` and `exchangeRateNativeToUsd`. These are useful for determining how much to approve upfront or for displaying the cost to your users.

## Steps

::::steps
### Define imports and create the clients

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-calculate-costs.ts:clients]
```

### Fetch quote info for a certain token

For this example, we will be fetching quote info for USDC on base.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-calculate-costs.ts:fetchQuotes]
```

### Calculate your userOperation's prefund

The prefund represents your userOperation's max cost.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-calculate-costs.ts:calculatePrefund]
```

### Calculate your userOperation's maxCost in denomination of the ERC-20 token

To find the cost of your userOperation in denomition of the ERC-20, you should use this formula. This is the same formula that the paymaster executes onchain, the source code can be found on the [singleton-paymaster repo.](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/singleton-paymaster/blob/08c85d3190db5110a37f1a8555797ec63b6984ec/src/base/BaseSingletonPaymaster.sol#L326-L341)

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-calculate-costs.ts:calculateCostInToken]
```

### Calculate your userOperation's maxCost in denomination of USD

The exchangeRateNativeToUsd represents the exchange rate of the chain's native gas token to USD. The value is returned with 6 digits of precision, to calculate the USD cost in a human readable format, you first need to find it's raw value and then divide it by 10^6.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-calculate-costs.ts:calculateUsdCost]
```
