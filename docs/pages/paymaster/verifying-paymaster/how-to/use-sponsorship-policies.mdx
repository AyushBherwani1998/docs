# How to use Sponsorship Policies

Sponsorship Policies are hosted policies that allow you to define custom rules for sponsorships.

You can put limits to the global amount of sponsorships, the amount of sponsorships per user, and per user operation.

Start by going to the [sponsorship policies page](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/sponsorship-policies) on the Pimlico dashboard and clicking on the "Create Policy" button.

After creating a policy, you can take its ID and use it by passing it into the `pm_sponsorUserOperation` method. If the user operation does not meet the requirements of the policy, the method will return an error.
