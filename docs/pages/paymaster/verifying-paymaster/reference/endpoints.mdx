# Verifying Paymaster Endpoints

All calls are in JSON-RPC format and have to be made to the following URL: `https://api.pimlico.io/v2/{chain}/rpc?apikey=[YOUR_API_KEY_HERE]`

Where `{chain}` is the chain variable (such as `goerli` or `polygon`) as found in the [supported chains page](/paymaster/verifying-paymaster/reference/supported-chains)

## pm_sponsorUserOperation (v2)

`pm_sponsorUserOperation` is the main endpoint for verifying paymasters. It takes in a User Operation, simulates it and estimates the gas limits, and then signs the User Operation with the verifying paymaster's key, sponsoring it when it is submitted on-chain. If successful, we deduct from your off-chain Pimlico balance.

You can optionally pass in a third parameter, `sponsorshipPolicyId`, which is a string that you can use to identify the sponsorship policy you want to use. To learn more about sponsorship policies, see [Sponsorship Policies](/paymaster/verifying-paymaster/how-to/use-sponsorship-policies).

To use this endpoint, you must have an API key with Pimlico. Use our [Quick Start](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/apikeys) guide to generate one.

User Operations sponsored using pm_sponsorUserOperation have a 10 minute time window during which they must be included. After this time window elapses, all unused gas will be refunded to your Pimlico balance.

This time limit is necessary in order to avoid DoS attacks, as leaving an infinite time window would allow potential attackers to accumulate User Operations and drain Pimlico's paymaster all in one go, requiring us to maintain enough balance to cover all possible User Operations we ever signed up to sponsor in the entire history of the paymaster.

If you require a longer time window for your User Operations, please get in touch!

## pm_validateSponsorshipPolicies

## pm_sponsorUserOperation (v1)

:::warning
v1 of the API is deprecated and will be removed in the future. Please use v2 instead.

User Operations sponsored using pm_sponsorUserOperation have a 10 minute time window during which they must be included. After this time window elapses, all unused gas will be refunded to your Pimlico balance.

This time limit is necessary in order to avoid DoS attacks, as leaving an infinite time window would allow potential attackers to accumulate User Operations and drain Pimlico's paymaster all in one go, requiring us to maintain enough balance to cover all possible User Operations we ever signed up to sponsor in the entire history of the paymaster.
