# How to Send Multiple Transactions

The permissionless.js library allows you to send multiple transactions at once or in parallel. This can be useful if you want to handle multiple transactions in a single user action or if you want to send transactions concurrently.

## Sending Multiple Transactions

To send multiple transactions in a single user action, you can use the `sendTransactions` method.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/how-to/transactions/multiple-parallel.ts:multiple-transactions]
```

## Sending Multiple Transactions in Parallel

In an Externally Owned Account (EOA), the `nonce` is a simple incrementing number. However, in smart accounts, the `nonce` consists of two components: a `key` and a `sequence`:

- 192-bit “key”
- 64-bit “sequence”

For each unique `key`, the sequence must be incremented by 1 for each transaction. This means that if you send multiple transactions in parallel, you can use different `keys` for the parallel transactions

In the example below, we use the current timestamp as the `key` to send parallel transactions. You can use any other value as the `key`.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/how-to/transactions/multiple-parallel.ts:multiple-transactions-parallel]
```

This way, you can efficiently manage multiple transactions either sequentially or concurrently.
