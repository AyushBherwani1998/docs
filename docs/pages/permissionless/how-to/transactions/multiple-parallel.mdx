# How to send multiple transactions

permissionless.js allows you to send multiple transactions in one go or in parallel.
This can be useful if you want to send multiple transactions in a single user operation or if you want to send multiple transactions in parallel.

## Sending multiple transactions

If you just want to send multiple transactions in a single user operation, you can use the `sendTransactions` method.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/how-to/transactions/multiple-parallel.ts:multiple-transactions]
```

## Send multiple transactions in parallel

In EOA, `nonce` is a simple incrementing number while in smart accounts, the nonce is a combination of two components: a `key` and a `sequence`:

- 192-bit “key”
- 64-bit “sequence”

For each unique `key`, sequence must be incremented by 1 for each transaction.
This means that if you send multiple transactions in parallel, you can use different `key` for parallel transactions.

In the below example, we are using current timestamp as the `key` to send parallel transactions. You can use any other value as the `key`.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/how-to/transactions/multiple-parallel.ts:multiple-transactions-parallel]
```
