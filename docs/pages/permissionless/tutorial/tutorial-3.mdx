# Tutorial 3 â€” Submit a user operation with an ERC-20 Paymaster

:::note
This is a low-level tutorial that walks you through the steps of constructing a user operation from scratch. If you would like to leverage permissionless.js's high-level functions, take a look at [tutorial 1](/permissionless/tutorial/tutorial-1). If you would like to learn more about leveraging the ERC-20 paymaster with the high-level API, take a look at the [relevant how-to guide](/permissionless/how-to/paymasters/use-custom-paymaster).
:::

:::info
You can visit our [ERC-20 Paymaster overview page](/paymaster/erc20-paymaster) to learn more about the design and architecture of our ERC-20 Paymaster, and the deployed smart contract addresses.
:::

In this tutorial, you will deploy an ERC-4337 smart contract wallet on Mumbai, and submit a User Operation that pays for its gas fees with USDC using Pimlico's ERC-20 Paymaster.

::::steps

### Get a Pimlico API key

:::info
**The ERC-20 paymaster itself is completely permissionless, there is no requirement to use an API key for it**. We are using an API key in this tutorial to get access to the bundler and verifying paymaster to make the tutorial flow easier.
:::

To get started, please go to our [dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io) and generate a Pimlico API key.


### Clone the Pimlico tutorial template repository

We have created a [Pimlico tutorial template repository](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/tutorial-template) that you can use to get started. It comes set up with Typescript, viem, and permissionless.js.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pimlicolabs/tutorial-template.git pimlico-tutorial-3
cd pimlico-tutorial-3
```

Now, let's install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

The main file we will be working with is `index.ts`. Let's run it to make sure everything is working:

```bash
npm start
```

If everything has been set up correctly, you should see `Hello world!` printed to the console.

### Define the constants we'll need

Let's open up `index.ts`.

First, let's define some of the constants we'll need to use to make the flow work. 

Before going any further, let's replace `privateKey` with a new private key. You can use the randomly generated one below, or by calling `generatePrivateKey()`.

:::warning
Do not use this private key in production. 
:::

<GeneratePrivateKey />

Remember to replace the `apiKey` variable with your own Pimlico API key. This will allow you to use our bundler to submit your User Operation.

After replacing these two variables, add the following to the bottom of `index.ts`:

```typescript
// [!include ~/snippets/tutorial-3.ts:constants]
```

### Calculate the deterministic address of your smart wallet

Since we will be looking to fund our account with USDC (that we will use to sponsor UserOperations with), we need to know the address where our smart wallet will be deployed.

Add the following to the bottom of `index.ts`:

```typescript
// [!include ~/snippets/tutorial-3.ts:sender]
```

Let's run this code with `npm start`. You should see something like this:

```txt
Counterfactual sender address: 0xbAd38BdCf884ED92ab370f69C0CD0B7b8a1459A1
```

### Get Testnet USDC on Mumbai

Let's get some USDC on the Mumbai testnet to the counterfactual address of the wallet we will be deploying. This will be used to pay for the gas fees of the User Operations we will be submitting.

The recommended way to do this is to use the [USDC faucet](https://usdcfaucet.com/), select POLYGON and enter the counterfactual sender address you generated in the previous step.

Alternatively, if the above step does not work, you can get some testnet MATIC. Then, if you're using Metamask, [switch your chain to Mumbai](https://chainlist.org/chain/80001) and then [visit this page to swap some of the testnet MATIC to testnet USDC on Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0x9999f7Fea5938fD3b1E26A12c3f2fb024e194f97&exactAmount=1&exactField=input&chain=mumbai) and then send that USDC to the counterfactual sender address.

### Deploy a SimpleWallet

In our [first tutorial](/permissionless/tutorial/tutorial-1) we went through an example flow where we deployed a [SimpleWallet](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/develop/contracts/samples/SimpleAccount.sol) using Pimlico's verifying paymaster and bundler. We will do something similar in this guide, except that we will be mainly looking to leverage the ERC-20 Paymaster.

During deployment, let's send an approval transaction that will approve unlimited USDC tokens to the ERC-20 Paymaster. This saves us an extra step and allows us to already start using the ERC-20 Paymaster starting from the next User Operation.

Add the following to the bottom of `index.ts`:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/tutorial-3.ts:deploy]
```

Let's run this code with `npm start`. The wallet should get deployed and you should see something like this:

```txt
Receipt not found...
Receipt not found...
Receipt found!
Transaction hash: 0x23d480c51578d78a15a1fd3fcc0c0aa1658eb27a9edc36ce442e1b79363a74ba
```

Now, if you go to the `sender` variable's address on [Mumbai Scan](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com), you should see a contract deployed there!

### Send a User Operation, paying only with USDC using the ERC-20 Paymaster

Now that we have a smart wallet deployed with USDC approved to the ERC-20 Paymaster address, let's submit another User Operation. but paying solely with USDC this time!

For this step, we'll leverage the `@pimlico/erc20-paymaster` SDK to verify that enough tokens are approved to the paymaster and to generate the `paymasterAndData` that will ask Pimlico's ERC-20 paymaster to sponsor the User Operation in exchange for USDC. 

Add the following to the bottom of `index.ts`:

```typescript
// [!include ~/snippets/tutorial-3.ts:submit]
```

If we run this code with `npm start`, a User Operation will be submitted using the ERC-20 Paymaster. Since we approved USDC to the paymaster in the previous step, the paymaster will be able to withdraw the required amount of USDC from your wallet to fund the gas cost. You should see something like this:

```txt
Sponsoring a user operation with the ERC-20 paymaster...
Receipt not found...
Receipt not found...
Receipt found!
Transaction hash: 0x23d480c51578d78a15a1fd3fcc0c0aa1658eb27a9edc36ce442e1b79363a74ba
```

If you visit the address of the `sender` account on [Mumbai Scan](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com), you should also see that some of your USDC balance has been deducted!

That's it! 

Congratulations, you have submitted your first User Operation using Pimlico's ERC-20 Paymaster! From now on, you will no longer need to keep native gas tokens like ETH and MATIC on your wallet to be able to transact. ðŸŽ‰

## Combined code

If you want to see the complete code that combines all of the previous steps, we uploaded it to a [separate repository](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/tutorials). If you're looking to run it, remember to replace the API key with your own and to use the [USDC Faucet](https://usdcfaucet.com/) to fill your counterfactual sender address with some USDC after you calculate it.
