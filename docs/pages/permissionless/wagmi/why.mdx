# Why @permissionless/wagmi [A summary of why we built @permissionless/wagmi ]

## Problems

In our journey of building permissionless.js, we realized there was a growing need for better tools that streamline the user experience and simplify development processes with wagmi, especially when it comes to smart accounts and paymaster services. With the rise of ERC-4337 and other innovations, developers face unnecessary complexity in handling external accounts, smart contracts, and paymaster logic.

The core motivation behind @permissionless/wagmi is to eliminate this friction and offer a seamless integration with the popular `wagmi` library, making it much easier for developers to work with smart accounts and ERC-7677 paymaster services. 

## Great developer experience

Developer experience is the cornerstone of @permissionless/wagmi's design. We're committed to providing strongly-typed TypeScript APIs, comprehensive documentation on every function, and an intuitive and legible style that doesn't require you to constantly jump around files to understand the code that has been written.

## Built on top of existing tools

Developers should not have to learn a completely new framework to make their apps leverage smart accounts. [viem](https://viem.sh) and [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) have established themselves as the most popular libraries for Ethereum development, so @permissionless/wagmi is built as a thin layer on top of them reusing as much of their standards and styles as possible. This means less work for us, and less work for developers who want to build with smart accounts.

## Avoiding lock-in

Crypto developers don't like lock-in. In a world where the infrastructure provider whose proprietary SDK you've spent the last year building your app on can disappear overnight, you want to make sure that you can easily swap out different parts of the stack as you see fit, including that of the original creator of the library. If we as Pimlico want to see smart accounts succeed, we're going to have to build tooling that benefits the entire ecosystem, not just the users of our own infrastructure.
